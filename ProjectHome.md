ooVoo is a Web Video Chat platform which allows developers to create web sites with video chat features.  The API consists of a set of AJAX and REST functions which manipulate the ooVoo Video Widget.  The widget runs as an ActiveX control or a Java Applet.  Silverlight and Flash support are planned for 2010.
